# Core Principles for Traders

A relatively short list of principles under which traders should operate. These are intended to be applicable to
virtually any financial market trader, e.g. options traders, swing traders, day traders and just to make a few examples.

The below are each equally important and have their own standalone merit:

* **Respect Risk: Capital is Lifeblood. Survival comes First.** It is not possible to succeed without capital. Every
   trade that I put on has the potential to end my career if I fail to respect the risk. The market is wholly indifferent 
   to my success or failure, and there is no practical limit changes in price. I must always manage risk. 

* **Trading is a Business Opportunity** Traders purchase assets and sell them at a higher price than which said assets
   where purchased. Successful traders have the potential to manage capital as a service. It is possible to succeed at
   these things and this is true because other people have succeeded. As with any other business opportunity, it is
   extremely difficult to accomplish this and requires knowledge, experience and discipline. I must approach it from
   this perspective in order to succeed. 

* **Equity Growth is Stochastic** Pure arbitrage opportunities are practically non-existent in the marketplace today,
   therefore every trade has an uncertain outcome. Therefore, gyrations in my equity curve are unavoidable and expected. 
   I will not allow myself to be depressed by drawdowns, nor will I allow myself to be exuberant during periods of
   equity growth. 

* **Success is Purely Defined by Equity Growth** In trading, consistent profitability is the only measure of success.
   Within ethical and legal bounds, I will not allow anything other than this objective to influence my trading
   decisions. 

* **Be Optimistic but not Unrealistic** It is healthy to be optimistic and excited about future possibilities, but it
   is unhealthy to have an inner dialogue that is unrealistic. It is healthy to be realistic, but unhealthy to be
   dominated by fear or pessimism. I will maintain an optimistic but not unrealistic inner dialogue. 

* **Consistency is the Key to Success** Traders succeed by consistently applying a methodology, every day, week, month
   and year. This consistency allows traders to responsibly manage risk and exploit opportunities for profit. I apply
   and develop my methodology every day. 

* **Low-Probability Events are Inevitable** Even an event with a probability that is a rounding error is guaranteed to
   happen over enough occurences. There are about 250 trading days in a year; this means that if a trader is continually
   exposed to an event with probability of 0.5%, the trader will experience this event, on average, every year.
   Destruction is assued if this event has a negative effect that is large enough. I will never allow myself to small
   probabilities as impossibilities. 

* **Don't let good things go bad or bad things get worse** A smaller loss is better than a larger one. A small profit
   is better than a big loss. I will not inappropriately hold onto losing trades, and I will not let profits slip away
   without a good justification.

* **Large Profit is the goal** There are much easier ways to make a stable income than by trading and the market
   does not deal out regular paychecks; therefore aggressive capital appreciation must be the goal of trading. I will
   not expect the market to pay me on a regular basis, and I will maintain in my mind that the goal is to make a large
   amount of profit.
